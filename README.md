# medixDB

## Overview

medixDB is a centralized healthcare records management system designed to streamline patient data management across healthcare facilities in Nigeria. It addresses the challenges of fragmented and inefficient patient record-keeping, which leads to delays in care and increases in fatalities.

By assigning a unique Health Identification Number (HIN) to each patient, medixDB allows healthcare providers to access, update, and share records in real time. This secure and unified system ensures that critical health information is available whenever and wherever it's needed.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Records:** Patient health records are accessible across all healthcare facilities, reducing delays and ensuring continuity of care.
- **Health Identification Number (HIN):** Each patient has a unique identifier for their health records, similar to the National Identification Number (NIN).
- **Secure Data Management:** medixDB uses encryption, audit trails, and access controls to protect patient data.
- **Integration with Other Systems:** medixDB integrates with insurance, laboratory information systems (LIS), and pharmacy management systems.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Ensures compliance with global data protection laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), safeguarding patient privacy.

## Problem Statement

Inefficient and fragmented healthcare records in Nigerian hospitals lead to long wait times and delays in patient care. According to research conducted by IISTE in Osun State, Nigeria:
- 39% of patient deaths are due to care delays.
- The average wait time per patient is 178 minutes.

medixDB addresses these issues by providing a single source of truth for patient data, accessible to authorized healthcare professionals across facilities.

## Business Model

medixDB operates on a **B2B2C** model with revenue generated through:
1. **Subscription Fees** – Healthcare facilities pay a recurring fee for access.
2. **Integration Fees** – Charges for connecting medixDB with other electronic systems.
3. **Data Analytics Services** – Anonymized healthcare data is analyzed and offered as a service to healthcare providers.
